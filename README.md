# Introduction
A tool that I have been working on. It will generate some useful output with DNA sequence input.

ðŸ§¬ Central Dogma: DNA â†’ mRNA â†’ Protein
DNA stays in the nucleus (safe, master copy).

Transcription: DNA is copied into mRNA.

mRNA leaves nucleus and goes to a ribosome in the cytoplasm.

Translation begins:

mRNA is read in sets of 3 letters (codons).

Each codon tells which amino acid is needed.

tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome.

Ribosome links amino acids together â†’ Protein is built!

# How to execute (Example on Linux terminal)
```
python3 main.py
```
# Docker
- will be updated
  
# Requirements
- Python3(any version)
- DNAToolkit.py
- main.py
- structures.py
- utilities.py

# Input
DNA sequence

# Output
- Sequence length
